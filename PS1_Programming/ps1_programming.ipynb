    "\"\"A truly random game of rock-paper-scissors would result in a statistical tie with each player winning, tying and losing one-third of the time. However, people are not truly random and thus can be studied and analyzed. While this computer won’t win all rounds, over time it can exploit a person’s tendencies and patterns to gain an advantage over its opponent.\"\"\n",

    "Now play the game of the rock-paper-scissors against the computer at least 100 times while you record the outcome (your moves & the computer’s move) at each time into a text ﬁle. Record the score at the bottom of the ﬁle, i.e. your number of wins, losses and ties out of N tries (N ≥ 100). Now use this ﬁle to come up with some algorithm that takes as input the history to how the game has been played and estimate your best move for the next round. Put this algorithm into a simple program (use python 3.x) and play the computer again at least the same number of times you played before, but this time using your program. Record the score (hopefully there is an improvement in your score!!). Hint: the more you play the better you may be at guessing\n",
